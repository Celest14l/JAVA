# Card Deck Simulation

## Overview
This is a Java-based project that simulates a standard 52-card deck. It includes functionality to create, shuffle, display, and deal cards, as well as additional features to search and compare cards. The project consists of three main files: `Card.java`, `Deck.java`, and `Main.java`.

## Features
- Create a standard 52-card deck (13 ranks Ã— 4 suits).
- Shuffle and display the deck.
- Deal cards to players or select random cards.
- Search for specific cards or cards with matching suits/ranks.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed.
- A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a terminal/command line for compilation and execution.

## Project Structure
- **`Card.java`**: Defines the `Card` class, representing a single playing card with a rank and suit.
- **`Deck.java`**: Defines the `Deck` class, managing a collection of cards with various operations.
- **`Main.java`**: Contains the `main` method to demonstrate the functionality of the `Deck` class.

## Installation
1. **Clone or Download**: Obtain the source code files (`Card.java`, `Deck.java`, `Main.java`).
2. **Place in a Directory**: Save all three files in the same directory (e.g., `CardDeckSimulation`).

## Compilation and Execution
1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the files.
2. Compile the files:
